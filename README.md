# OFID Task Automation

âš™**OFID (Order Files into Directories)** is a script tool designed to organize disorganized files in a folder based on their file extension.

ðŸ’¡Considering the existence of various and different file extensions, this script will be able to analyze the type of each file (for example, .pdf, .docx, .png, etc.) and classify them accordingly. This approach helps maintain a logical and structured order of files within a folder that could otherwise become disorganized, thus facilitating their management and access.

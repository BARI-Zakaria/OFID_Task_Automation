‚öô **OFID (Order Files into Directories)** is a script tool designed to organize disorganized files in a folder based on their file extension.

üí° Considering the existence of various and different file extensions, this script will be able to analyze the type of each file (for example, **.pdf, .docx, .png,** etc.) and classify them accordingly. This approach helps maintain a logical and structured order of files within a folder that could otherwise become disorganized, thus facilitating their management and access.

‚ùì **How it works ?**

2. Choose the directory where you will place it.

3. Open **PowerShell**.


4. Change Directorie to the folder where the script exist : ***cd*** *C:\<folder-path>*.

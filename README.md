# OFID Task Automation

OFID (Order Files into Directories) is a task automation tool designed to organize disorganized files in a folder based on their file extension.

Considering the existence of various and different file extensions, this task will be able to analyze the type of each file (for example, .pdf, .docx, .png, etc.) and classify them accordingly. This approach helps maintain a logical and structured order of files within a folder that could otherwise become disorganized, thus facilitating their management and access.
